# WKP-21st-Graph-Generation
A small weekend project based upon a problem that came up in Graph Theory.Given some set of Nodes and their respective available number of edges, the program should generate a graph.Currently allows nodes to generate an edge to itself (something that will need to be fixed).Uses networkx and matplotlib as visualizers.
